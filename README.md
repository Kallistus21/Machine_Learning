- Project focusing on clustering and dimension reduction.
- Utilized a dataset containing various countries characteristics (e.g., literacy, infant mortality, GDP).
- Applied K-means clustering to identify tendencies in the dataset.
- Employed dimension reduction technique called PCA (Principal component analysis) to determine variables retaining the most information.

[Associaton rules - market basket analysis](https://rpubs.com/pbugajski/1155842):
- Project centered around market basket analysis using association rules.
